The Mercado Livre (https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/) hosts millions of lists of products and services. Users browse through them numerous times, in search of what they want to buy or just to come up with ideas for a new purchase.

Better understanding of what users may be interested in is fundamental to our business. In order for us to help you find what you are looking for, we provide personalized recommendations based on the most appropriate lists for each user's needs and preferences.

Given a six-month period of browsing logs for a given user, we challenge you to predict (or recommend) the ten most likely items for your next purchase.
